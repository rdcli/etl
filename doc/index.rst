Extract Transform Load (ETL) toolkit for python.

`Looking for an ETL for python 3.5+? Discover Bonobo.<https://www.bonobo-project.org/>`_

DIY framework to create multithreaded python callables that can transform any stream(s) of key/value lists into any
other stream(s).

Concepts are similar to heavy market tools like talend or pentaho, but unlike those, it's a lightweight framework and
there is no wysiwyg editor provided.
